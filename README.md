To-Do List Application
Overview
Welcome to my To-Do List application! This project is designed to help you manage your tasks efficiently. You can add new tasks, edit or delete existing ones, and mark them as complete. The goal is to provide a simple yet powerful tool for task management.

Features
Adding Tasks
You can easily add new tasks by entering the task description and clicking the "Add" button. This will add the task to your list of to-dos.

Editing Tasks
Need to update a task? No problem! Click the "Edit" button next to the task, make your changes, and save. The task will be updated accordingly.

Deleting Tasks
Once a task is no longer needed, you can remove it by clicking the "Delete" button. This will permanently delete the task from your list.

Marking Tasks as Complete
You can mark tasks as complete by clicking the checkbox next to the task. This helps you keep track of what youâ€™ve accomplished. You can also unmark a task if needed.

Viewing and Filtering Tasks
All tasks are displayed in a list format. You can filter tasks to see only completed or incomplete ones, making it easier to focus on what needs to be done.
